# REMOTE-SENSING-CHANGE-DETECTION-IN-OPTICAL-IMAGES-USING-RANDOM-FOREST
Remote sensing change detection project from my SAC ISRO research internship. Built an end-to-end ML pipeline in Python (NumPy, pandas, Rasterio, Scikit-learn) and QGIS on multi-temporal Sentinel‑2 imagery, achieving 95.67% accuracy and generating binary urban change maps that reduced manual analysis effort by over 70%.
